# Insurance-Premium-Prediction
Built a regression-based machine learning system to predict medical insurance premiums using demographic and health-related data. Performed comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key cost drivers such as smoking habits, BMI, and age.
Categorical variables were encoded, and correlation analysis revealed a strong influence of smoking and obesity on premium charges. Applied Box-Cox transformation to normalize skewed data, improving model performance.
Developed and evaluated both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models. The Random Forest model outperformed in both training and testing accuracy. Visualized feature importances and model residuals to assess fit quality. The project demonstrated how predictive analytics can assist insurers in pricing strategies and risk assessment.

Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Box-Cox Transformation, Random Forest
